Hello! I am an Assistant Professor at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/) and [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/equipes/stat/index).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the team [DAO](https://dao-ljk.imag.fr/), at LJK, Université Grenoble Alpes where I worked on statistical aspects of Wasserstein distributionally robust models. I completed my PhD (October 2023) at Toulouse School of Economics (TSE) and ANITI, supervized by Jérôme Bolte and Edouard Pauwels. I worked on stochastic, nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization in machine learning. Some questions I studied there included convergence guarantees when using automatic differentiation in stochastic algorithms (e.g. SGD in deep learning), and nonsmooth implicit differentiation applied to optimization layers and hyperparameter selection.
