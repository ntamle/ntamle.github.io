Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the team [DAO](https://dao-ljk.imag.fr/), at LJK, Université Grenoble Alpes. I work on statistical aspects of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization.

Previously, I completed my PhD (October 2023) at Toulouse School of Economics (TSE) and ANITI, supervized by Jérôme Bolte (TSE) and Edouard Pauwels (formerly IRIT, Université Toulouse 3-now TSE). I worked on stochastic, nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization in machine learning.


## Pre-prints

* Universal Generalization Guarantees for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Models, T. Le and J. Malick, submitted to ICML 2024

## Publications

* Nonsmooth Implicit Differentiation for Machine Learning and Optimization J. Bolte, T. Le, E. Pauwels, A. Silveti-Falls, NeurIPS 2021. \[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04350)\]
* Subgradient sampling for nonsmooth nonconvex minimization, J. Bolte, T. Le, E. Pauwels, SIAM Journal on Optimization 2023 \[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13744)\]
* Nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic heavy ball, to appear in Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 2024 \[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13328)\]


## Thesis
